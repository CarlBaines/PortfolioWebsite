# PortfolioWebsite
This repository contains the HTML, CSS and other related files used to create my portfolio website. I am still working on this portfolio website because I still need to make the website responsive which I need to learn how to do, so that the design of the website can respond to the behaviour and the environment it is used on e.g. different screen size, device, platform etc. Some parts of this website may also need to be updated which I will do in time.
